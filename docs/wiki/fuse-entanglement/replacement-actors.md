# Replacement Actors

## Summary

Sorry if you're viewing this page right now. The table was not good and I'm actively running formatting tests to see what works best

- Some fusible objects ("actors") replace themselves with another actor (sometimes of the same type) when fused. Without special considerations, attempting to Fuse Entangle these actors will _crash the game_.
- This page contains an easily-digestible table of such "Replacement Actors", with both the actor ID and a plain translation of which object this ID corresponds to, along with the equivalents for what the actor is replaced with.
- Additionally, some replacement actors return the original actor when defused via Pelison. When this is the case, it will be denoted in the tables below.
